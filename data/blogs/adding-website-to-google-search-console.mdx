# 📈 Add Your Website to Google Search Console

**Google Search Console (GSC)** is a free tool that helps you monitor and optimize your site's presence in Google Search results. Whether you're running a blog, portfolio, or product website, adding it to GSC is essential for SEO.

## ✅ Step 1: Visit Google Search Console

Go to 👉 [https://search.google.com/search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console)

- Sign in with your Google account
- Click **“Start now”**

## 🏡 Step 2: Add Your Property (Website)

You'll see two options:

1. **Domain** (e.g., `yourdomain.com`) — requires DNS access
2. **URL Prefix** (e.g., `https://yourdomain.com`) — easier for beginners

👉 Choose **URL Prefix**, especially if you don’t want to edit DNS settings.

Enter your full URL (e.g., `https://thecodingvibes.dev`) and click **Continue**.

## 🔐 Step 3: Verify Ownership

Google gives several verification methods. The most common:

### ✅ HTML Tag (best for frontend projects)

1. Choose **HTML tag** option
2. Copy the `<meta>` tag

```html
<meta name="google-site-verification" content="your-verification-code" />
```
