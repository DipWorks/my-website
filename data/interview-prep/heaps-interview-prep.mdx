# 🛠️ Heaps for Interviews

A **Heap** is a special tree-based data structure that satisfies the **heap property**:

- **Min Heap**: Parent node ≤ its children
- **Max Heap**: Parent node ≥ its children

Heaps are commonly used to implement **priority queues**, **scheduling**, and for efficient **selection problems** like finding the _k smallest/largest_ elements.

## 🌳 Structure and Properties

- Binary Heap is a **complete binary tree** (all levels filled left to right).
- Typically implemented using an array:
  - For index `i`:
    - `left = 2i + 1`
    - `right = 2i + 2`
    - `parent = Math.floor((i - 1) / 2)`

## 🔄 Types of Heaps

### ✅ Min Heap

Smallest element is at the root.

```ts
// Example: [1, 3, 6, 5, 9, 8]
       1
     /   \
    3     6
   / \   /
  5   9 8
```
