# ðŸ”— Linked Lists for Interviews

A **Linked List** is a linear data structure where each element (called a _node_) points to the next one. Unlike arrays, linked lists donâ€™t require contiguous memory.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Use Linked Lists?

- Dynamic size: Efficient insertions/deletions.
- No memory reallocation like arrays.
- Used in stacks, queues, and graphs.

---

## ðŸ§± Structure of a Node

```ts
class ListNode {
  value: number;
  next: ListNode | null;

  constructor(value: number) {
    this.value = value;
    this.next = null;
  }
}
```
