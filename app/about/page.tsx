        My name is <strong>Dipendra Bhandari</strong> and I am a{" "}
        <strong>Senior Software Engineer </strong>
        based in Sydney, Australia.
        <br />
        <br /> 
        I decided to create this website to write blogs related to software development and software engineering in general. I try to shed light on simple things that everybody else has ignored
        but that are still making life of Software Engineer difficult. I write articles or tutorials on stuff that is hard to find on the internet but would make our life so much easier if somebody wrote about the before. ðŸ˜Š
